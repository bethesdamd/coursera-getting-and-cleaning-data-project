# There are 561 features in features.txt
# X_test has 2947 lines of data with 561 records each
# Y_test has only 2947 records total, so I guess it's one column of data
# 1,653,267 total elements once cleaned
#
# X_train has 7352 lines with 561 records per line
# Y_train has 7352 records total, so one column
# 4,124,472 total records

# every 16 characters is a record, right-justified

# So I guess cbind Y_test to the first column of X_test
# and cbind Y_train to the first column of X_train
# Then rbind 561 records of features.txt to the first row of both, which both have 561 columns
